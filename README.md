Description
===========

Provides an LWRP to declare that a directory's contents are entirely
managed by Chef.  When a node is converged, any files present in the
`managed_directory` that are not managed by Chef will be removed.


Requirements
============

Platform
--------

Known to work on CentOS and OS X.  Should work on other Unix-like
systems.


Resource/Provider
=================

`managed_directory`
---------------------------

Ensure that a directory contains only files put there by Chef in this
run.  Any other files will be removed.

### Actions

- `:clean` - Remove any unmanaged files.

### Attribute Parameters

- `path` - (name attribute) The absolute path to the directory to be managed.
- `clean_files` - Boolean to determine whether unmanaged files should be
  removed. Default is `true`.
- `clean_links` - Boolean to determine whether unmanaged links should be
  removed. Default is `true`.
- `clean_directories` - Boolean to determine whether unmanaged subdirectories
  should be removed. Default is `false`.


Usage
=====

default
-------

Include the default recipe in a run list to make the resource
available in your run.

test
----

The 'test' recipe illustrates use of the `managed_directory` resource.

test_directories
----------------

The 'test_directories' recipe illustrates use of the `managed_directory`
resource when having it clean up unwanted subdirectories.


Caveats
=======

 * The directory to be managed must already exist.  If you also need
   to ensure that the directory exists, use the Directory resource
   separately.

 * If you require subdirectories to be managed as well, be sure to set the
   `clean_directories` attribute to `true`

 * A file is considered to be managed if there is a resource with a
   name attribute equal to the file's full path.  It will do the wrong
   thing if this assumption is not true for the contents of your
   directory.

 * Files managed by resources created after this LWRP is converged
   (eg, from within a `ruby_block` or LWRP later in the run list) will
   be incorrectly identified as "unmanaged", and then deleted.  They
   will be recreated later in the run, but this creates a window where
   the file is missing. For a work-around, you can define the
   `managed_directory` with `action :none` and use another resource to notify
   it `:delayed`. For example, if you're using the `yum` cookbook to manage
   all your repositories, you might do something like:

```ruby
managed_directory '/etc/yum.repos.d' do
  action :nothing
  clean_directories true
end

ruby_block 'delayed_managed_directory /etc/yum.repos.d' do
  block { true }
  notifies	:clean, 'managed_directory[/etc/yum.repos.d]', :delayed
end
```
